# Problem 1

For this exercise, we will be examining the early_january_weather dataset.

```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
```


Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
